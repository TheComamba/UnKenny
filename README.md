# UnKenny - NPCs with artificial intelligence

## About

__UnKenny is currently in its beta phase. Whatever that means.__

UnKenny is a module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). It allows you to generate a tiny dialogue with a character, by providing them with a limited AI. The idea arose during our Starfinder game, because we wanted to simulate the interaction with a robotical NPC.

## Usage

After enabling the module for a world, click on the actor of your choice.

Click on "Make UnKenny" and enter a preamble. This is a short description of what the character needs to know about themselves. You will furthermore need to pick one of the available [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). Most are free of any charge, but to interact with OpenAI's GPT you will need to [set up and pay for an API key](https://blog.streamlit.io/beginners-guide-to-openai-api/).

As long as the preamble is not empty, the actor is considered *unkenny*. To speak to the actor, begin a chat message with the text macro `/(<actor>)`, where `<actor>` is the name or *unkenny alias* of the actor. Alternatively, mention the actor anywhere in your message using `@(<actor>)`. In the first case, the macro is removed from your chat message, while in the second case the mention is replaced with the actor's full name.

Your chat message is posted, and a short while later, the response generated by the large language model is posted below it.

## Manual Installation

To manually install UnKenny (e.g. for development), copy the src/ folder of this repository to the {userData}/Data/modules/ folder of Foundry, and then rename it to 'unkenny' (the id declared in module.json).

On POSIX compliant operating systems like Linux and Mac you can alternatively use a symbolic link. It can be created via e.g.

```bash
ln -s {folder containing git repo}/UnKenny/src {Foundry user data}/Data/modules/unkenny
```
